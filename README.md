# Chess Opening Book

## About

### Visually Impaired first approach

#### My thinking

It may be true that the percentage of people who are blind/ partially blind/ or otherwise visually impaired is probably quite low. However, even if that is true, if I can help even a handful of people who have such a condition improve at their chess that is more than enough of a reward to motivate this projects development.

I wanted to create a project that would help me learn about something I wanted to be better at: Web Accessibility.
And what better way to do that then by combining it with something I love (chess), while at the same time getting to help someone out (hopefully).
 

#### The goal: 

To create a site that allows people who may suffer from a visual impairment to be able to get meaningful insights from their chess games.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
